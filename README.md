# neural_net_talk_6-2-17

## Main talk

This is the repo for a talk I gave as a speaker at the [Chi Town Machine Learning Meetup Group](https://www.meetup.com/Chi-Town-Machine-Learning/events/239903619/) on June 6, 2017. It contains a Jupyter notebook that can be viewed using the [Reveal.js-based Jupyter notebook viewer](https://github.com/damianavila/RISE).

To walk through the slides, and the code, install the Reveal.js Jupyter notebook extension (at the second link above), and view the `Neural_net_talk_6-2.ipynb` file.

If you get stuck installing Reveal.js - or just don't want to go through the trouble of installing it - you can still walk through the notebook and run the code.

## Other learning resources

* This repo is intended to be a teaching tool, first and foremost. To that end, there is a cool class attribute trick used to make each `Layer` object class inherit certain properties from the `NeuralNetwork` object that it is a part of. Details on this trick, as well as a couple of links describing it in more detail, are in the `Cool class attribute trick.ipynb` file.

* The blog post explaining the bulk the equations used near the beginning of the talk - in the ~25 line `learn` function - are explained in [this blog post](http://sethweidman.com/neural_net_post_2).
